# [Samantha theme] for Spicetify

> A custom Spicetify theme featuring vibrant colors, cleaner interface features like hidden banners, and unique accents.
> It is a custom theme, that probably wont be used by anyone else, so it is highly presonalized (less images, no podcasts...)

Based on the **"text"** theme by [darkthemer](https://github.com/darkthemer).
